# Book_YouCanQuant
This is a group project of the QIT(Quantitative Investing & Trading) Working Group of the CFA Society Korea. Our goal is to implement in Python and apply on the Quantopian platform the contents of a Korean quantitative investment book, "You Can Quant Invest". Please understand that most contents will be in Korean only for now, which we would translate into English later. For questions contact me, Vero at vati27@gmail.com

I advise you to start with _Table_of_Contents.ipynb
